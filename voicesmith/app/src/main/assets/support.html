<p>Is the app freezing or crashing on your phone? Because of the smartphone variety, it's still not possible to test the app on every device before publishing it.</p>
<p>Please do some general steps at first:</p>
<ol>
    <li>Ensure your wired earphones or Bluetooth headset are properly connected.</li>
    <li>Change global preferences like sample rate &ndash; probably your smartphone doesn't support some values.</li>
</ol>
<p>If this doesn't help, please contact the developer via <a href="mailto:support@jurihock.de">support@jurihock.de</a> in English, German or Russian and describe how to reproduce the failure. The developer will contact you back as soon as possible and will try to help you.</p>
<p>If you're interested in further development of this open source hobby project, so actively help to improve it. Just giving a bad rating is useless!</p>
